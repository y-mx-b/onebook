## Introduction

### Why Create Onebook?

I use a lot of browsers. I regularly switch between Safari, Qutebrowser,
and Ungoogled Chromium (and sometimes Firefox as well) with little rhyme
or reason. But then, sometimes, you also want to be able to access all
your bookmarks from each browser without having to manually import and
export, or use different tools to import and export. Sometimes you also
just want to be able to hit a button and open a website, any website you
want.

The ability to easily import to and export from a single, local source,
and manage your bookmarks right from there, as well as quickly open your
bookmarks in a browser.

There is, naturally, a tool that does this.
[Buku](https://github.com/jarun/buku). But it doesn't natively support
Safari, and there are other browsers that it can't automatically import
from. Also, it's written in Python, and you must extend its capabilites
in Python (or perhaps write a wrapper for its library in another
language). Also, because it uses
[SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html), it is incredibly fast, but you
have to be able to parse SQLite databases in order to interact with the
data yourself, without Buku.

(I'm sure there are other tools out there, and I'm sure Buku is an
incredible bookmark manager as well. It just didn't suit me all too
well, and I thought creating a bookmark manager I'd like would be an
interesting project.)

Enter Onebook.

Just like [pass](https://www.passwordstore), the standard Unix password
manager, Onebook uses the filesystem to store its data in a very UNIX-y
way (perhaps I'll consider adding encryption to bookmarks as well,
though I don't see why that'd be necessary). That way, anyone can create
scripts to interact with the data in just about any language. Python,
Perl, JavaScript, or just plain shellâ€”all of it works just as well.
Anything that can interact with files and directories will be just as
capable.

### How Does It work?

**NOTE: This description may not be accurate, as Onebook is still under
heavy** **development. Please refer to the information under
[Functionality](#functionality) in order to** **get an accurate grasp of
where Onebook is currently at.**

First, Onebook will parse bookmarks from any browser of your choosing.
Since each browser has its own method for storing bookmarks, there is a
lot of work that goes into writing parsers for each browser's bookmark
system.

Onebook will also be able to take Netscape-style HTML bookmark files
(just about every browser allows you to export to Netscape-compatible
HTML).

Bookmarks are aggregated and managed under a storage directory
(`~/.bookmarks/` by default).

Bookmark folders are made into folders on the filesystem, while
individual bookmarks are stored as files with the bookmark's title as
the file's name. Any data pertaining to the bookmark will be stored
within the file (currently, in TOML).

You will be able to edit this data manually, or through Onebook.

You can then export bookmarks from Onebook to any of the formats
supported browsers use to store their own bookmarks, or to HTML. You
will also be able to automatically sync bookmarks between browsers with
a single command: `onebook sync`.

## Downloading

### [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint)

Download mint and run the following command.

    mint install luardemin/onebook

### Building From Source

**NOTE: Requires [git](https://github.com/git/git) and the [Swift
Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/).**

First, download the GitHub repository using the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/luardemin/onebook.git

Then do `cd onebook` to enter the directory. You can then build with
`swift
build` or run with `swift run onebook <subcommand>`.

## Basic Usage

Make sure `onebook` is on your
[path](https://www.putorius.net/set-path-variable-linux.html), then run:

    onebook init

To display the help message:

    $ onebook help

2.  Configuration

    -   [ ] Implement config file
        -   [ ] Set default browser for import/export
        -   [ ] Set custom storage directory
        -   [ ] Set default browsers to sync
